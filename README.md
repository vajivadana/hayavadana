# Hayavadana: Demonstration of Indian Knowledge System in Mathematics and Astronomy

The study of subjects like Mathematics is inalienable in the development of any civilization and we find copious references to Greek roots in modern mathematics, though similar contributions that merit in mention relatively fewer in number and find themselves a rather obscure even among students of the same in India, the cradle of many key contributions to Science and Mathematics.

On this note we attempt to study some key algorithms and their working through an implementation in Java with a visually lucid Swing UI implementation. We have based our work on some selected verses of classical authors including and not limiting to Lilavati, Sadratnamala, etc. We use JDBC, the persistence system offered by Java to store and readily access data in the same.

Our work tries to shed some light on the computational soundness of many algorithms by practical implementation and to encourage mathematical studies on the same in future.

# The Algorithms we consider
* Square root
* Cube root
* Kuttaka method of solving equations

# Technology Stack
## Swing GUI
* Swing
* AWT 

# Getting started with code
`javac Main.java && java Main`

# Working and Structure
* About - Brief about the project
* View - view selected shlokas and run selected verses live
* Background Information - Information about Bhaskaracharya

# Contents of Lilavati discussed
We study the contents of Lilavati through the following headers for the ease of understanding of a cursory reader familiar with Modern Mathematics 
* __Fundamental Operations__
* __Fractions__
* __On Infinity and Eight rules of Zero__
* __Reverse process and the concept of limits__
* __Ratio and Proportions__
* __Simple Interest, Progressions__
* __Algebra__
* __Squares and Cubes__
* __Trigonometry and Geometry__
* __Mensuration of Polygons and other objects__
* __Volume__
* __Discrete Mathematics__

* Would be added soon

# Further Enhancements
* Considering more Algorithms
* Interactive view of the entire lilavati
